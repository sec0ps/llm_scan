# Purpose: This module is part of the LLM Security Testing Framework, designed to
#          provide comprehensive security assessment capabilities for Large Language
#          Models and AI systems. It includes automated vulnerability detection,
#          prompt injection testing, business logic bypass detection, data extraction
#          analysis, and professional security reporting for authorized penetration
#          testing and security research.
#
# SECURITY NOTICE: This framework is intended for authorized security testing only.
#                  Users must obtain explicit permission before testing any LLM system.
#                  This tool is designed for defensive security purposes and should
#                  only be used in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
